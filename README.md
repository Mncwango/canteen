This was just me playing around with mvc with MongoDb
one of the things you will find in the project is the ASP.Net User management that is using mongoDb and
some CRUD Operation.

The project is not meant to be a real world project its just the demonstration of the above mentioned points.

you are more than welcome to download the code.
